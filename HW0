Team: Sara Borghei and Sara Saad

We want to create an interactive weather map which allows users to view the best weather for vacations spots depending on the date of travel.
This would satisfy requirement 1 because the user can choose locations, dates, and preferred weather. In return, they will be able to view the best options for travel.
This project will use Google maps and a weather API to satisfy requirement 2.
We will use Choropleth visualizations in D3 to satisfy requirement 3.
Lastly, the logic will interact with the API in pulling the information that the user requests to satisfy requirement 4.

We will color the areas/states on the map according to their weather. We wil propably need to use the ArcGIS web service to modify the map.
Also, we wish to make the website more helpful and interactive by allowing the user to view information about the area they are 
interested in visiting such as things to do.
